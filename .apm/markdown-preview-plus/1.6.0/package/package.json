Should you have any problems while\ninstalling or using MPP, or if you would like to see a new feature added please\nopen up a\n[new issue](https://github.com/Galadirith/markdown-preview-plus/issues/new).\n\n## Features\n\n- **LaTeX equation rendering**  \n  LaTeX equations in the source markdown are rendered in the preview pane.\n  Rendering of LaTeX equations in the preview pane can be toggled with\n  `ctrl-shift-x`. Please see [LaTeX](LATEX.md) for more details.\n\n- **Pandoc support**  \n  You can use [Pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc) to render the\n  markdown preview which provides a richer functionality including support to\n  define custom [pandoc arguments](http://pandoc.org/README.html#options),\n  adjust the [markdown flavor](http://pandoc.org/README.html#pandocs-markdown)\n  and enable [citation replacement](http://pandoc.org/README.html#citations).\n\n## Installation\n\n1.  **Check installation dependencies**  \n    The installation process uses\n    [node-gyp](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp) which is installed when\n    you installed atom. Please check the\n    [installation](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp#installation) section\n    of node-gyp to ensure you have all the programs installed that it requires\n    to run.\n\n2.  **Install MPP**  \n    Search for **Markdown Preview Plus** in the menu **File &rsaquo; Settings\n    &rsaquo; Install** and click **Install**. Please allow 3-5 mins for\n    installation. Alternatively if you would prefer to use the command line\n    utility `apm`:\n\n    ````bash\n    $ apm install markdown-preview-plus\n    ````\n\n3.  **Install mathjax-wrapper**  \n    Search for **mathjax-wrapper** in the menu **File &rsaquo; Settings &rsaquo;\n    Install** and click **Install**. Please allow 10-15 mins for installation\n    of mathjax-wrapper. Alternatively if you would prefer to use the command\n    line utility `apm`:\n\n    ````bash\n    $ apm install mathjax-wrapper\n    ````\n\n4.  **Disable Markdown Preview**  \n    Disable the built in Markdown Preview package. You can do this by searching\n    for **Markdown Preview** in the menu **File &rsaquo; Settings &rsaquo;\n    Packages** and clicking **Disable**.\n\n5.  **(Optional) Enable Pandoc**  \n    Optionally you may use Pandoc to render the Markdown preview. To enable\n    Pandoc within MPP:\n\n    1.  [Install pandoc](http://pandoc.org/installing.html)\n    2.  Run `which pandoc` and note the full path to the Pandoc executable.\n    3.  On the MPP settings page enable **Enable Pandoc Parser**\n    4.  Enter the path from step 2 into **Pandoc Options: Path**\n\n## Usage\n\n### Opening a preview\n\nIf you are editing a markdown document in atom you can open a preview with\n`ctrl-shift-m` that will update in real-time as you edit the document. You can\nalso right click on a markdown document in the tree-view and select **Markdown\nPreview** to open a standalone preview.\n\n### LaTeX equation rendering\n\nMPP extends the syntax of\n[GitHub flavored markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/)\nwith equation blocks. An equation block is indicated by enclosing it in double\ndollar signs `$$...$$`. You can use any LaTeX macros that are valid in a maths\nenvironment of a LaTeX document inside an equation block. Rendering of LaTeX\nequations in the document preview can be toggled with `ctrl-shift-x`.\n\nFor more details on using equations in MPP please see [LaTeX](LATEX.md).\n\n### Pandoc citation replacement\n\nIf you have enabled Pandoc to render the markdown preview then you can enable\ncitation replacement by enabling **Pandoc Options: Citations** on the MPP\nsettings page.\n\nMPP will now search for any file named *bibliography.bib* and *custom.csl*\nfrom the markdown's directory up. The first files that are matching will be\nused for Pandocs citations. You can change the filenames it is searching for\nby changing the options **Bibliography (bibfile)** and **Bibliography Style\n(cslfile)** on the settings page.\n\nHere is a small example how it works:\n````\n./\n├── bibliography.bib     <-- will be used by README.md\n├── custom.csl           <-- will be used by README.md & RANDOM.md\n├── src\n│   ├── bibliography.bib <-- will be used by RANDOM.md\n│   ├── otherbib.bib     <-- will not be used as filename does not match\n│   └── md\n│       └── RANDOM.md\n└── README.md\n````\nEffictively the arguments `--csl=/custom.csl --bibliography=/bibliography.bib`\nare used for `/README.md` and `--csl=/custom.csl\n--bibliography=/src/bibliography.bib` for `/src/md/RANDOM.md`\n\n## License\n\nMarkdown Preview Plus (MPP) is released under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md).\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/Galadirith/markdown-preview-plus/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/Galadirith/markdown-preview-plus","_id":"markdown-preview-plus@1.6.0","_shasum":"7ee40f559c486bee966b3cf031540d65e000463a","_resolved":"file:../d-115626-2153-osr7zs/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115626-2153-osr7zs/package.tgz"}
