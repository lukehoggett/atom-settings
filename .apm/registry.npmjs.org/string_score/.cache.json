Testing using Qunit\n* Proper - Passes jslint as well as meets the coding practices and principles of opinionated developers :-)\n* Fuzzyable - Optional parameter for fuzziness (allows mismatched info to still score the string)\n\n# See it in action\nCheck it out [http://joshaven.com/string_score](http://joshaven.com/string_score)\n\n## Installation Notes\nSimply include one of the string score JavaScript files and call the .score() method on any string.\n\n### NodeJS Installation\n    npm install --save string_score\n    require(\"string_score\");\n\nThats it! It will automatically add a .score() method to all JavaScript String object... \"String\".score(\"str\");\n\n# Examples\n(results are for example only... I may change the scoring algorithm without updating examples)\n\n    \"hello world\".score(\"axl\") //=> 0\n    \"hello world\".score(\"ow\")  //=> 0.35454545454545455\n\n    \"hello world\".score(\"e\")           //=>0.1090909090909091 (single letter match)\n    \"hello world\".score(\"h\")           //=>0.5363636363636364 (single letter match plus bonuses for beginning of word and beginning of phrase)\n    \"hello world\".score(\"he\")          //=>0.5727272727272728\n    \"hello world\".score(\"hel\")         //=>0.6090909090909091\n    \"hello world\".score(\"hell\")        //=>0.6454545454545455\n    \"hello world\".score(\"hello\")       //=>0.6818181818181818\n    ...\n    \"hello world\".score(\"hello worl\")  //=>0.8636363636363635\n    \"hello world\".score(\"hello world\") //=> 1\n\n    // And then there is fuzziness\n    \"hello world\".score(\"hello wor1\")  //=>0  (the \"1\" in place of the \"l\" makes a mismatch)\n    \"hello world\".score(\"hello wor1\",0.5)  //=>0.6081818181818182 (fuzzy)\n\n    // Considers string length\n    'Hello'.score('h') //=>0.52\n    'He'.score('h')    //=>0.6249999999999999  (better match becaus string length is closer)\n\n    // Same case matches better than wrong case\n    'Hello'.score('h') //=>0.52\n    'Hello'.score('H') //=>0.5800000000000001\n\n    // Acronyms are given a little more weight\n    \"Hillsdale Michigan\".score(\"HiMi\") > \"Hillsdale Michigan\".score(\"Hills\")\n    \"Hillsdale Michigan\".score(\"HiMi\") < \"Hillsdale Michigan\".score(\"Hillsd\")\n\n# Tested And Operational Under these environments\n\nFully functional in the 100% of the tested browsers:\n\n* Firefox 3 & Newer (Mac & Windows)\n* Safari 4 & Newer (Mac & Windows)\n* IE: 7 & Newer (Windows) **\n* Chrome: 2 & Newer (Windows)\n* Opera: 9.64 & Newer (Windows)\n\n** IE 7 fails (stop running this script message) with 4000 iterations\nof the benchmark test. All other browsers tested survived this test,\nand in fact survive a larger number of iterations.  The benchmark\nthat is causing IE to choke is: 4000 iterations of 446 character\nstring scoring a 70 character match.\n\n# Benchmarks\nThis is the fastest and smallest javascript string scoring plugin\nthat I am aware of.  I have taken great joy in squeezing every\nmillisecond I can out of this script.  If you are aware of any\nways to improve this script, please let me know.\n\nstring_score.js is faster and smaller and does more than either liquidmetal.js or quicksilver.js\n\nThe test: 4000 iterations of 446 character string scoring a 70-character match\n\n* string_score.js:\n  * Firefox 3.6 (805ms)\n  * Firefox 4 (245ms)\n  * Chrome 9 (268ms)\n  * Safari 5 (259ms)\n* liquidmetal.js:\n  * Firefox 3.6 (1578ms)\n  * Firefox 4 (853ms)\n  * Chrome 9 (339ms)\n  * Safari 5 (996ms)\n* quicksilver.js:\n  * Firefox 3.6 (3300ms)\n  * Firefox 4 (1994ms)\n  * Chrome 9 (2835ms)\n  * Safari 5 (3252ms)\n* fuzzy_string.js\n  * Firefox 4 (OUCH! I am not sure it heats up my laptop and asks if I want to stop the script... fuzzy_string, nice idea but it doesn't like large strings matches.)\n\n** Tests run with jQuery 1.5 on Mac Book Pro 2.4GHz Core 2 Duo running Snow Leopard\n*** quicksilver & string_score both use the same test file because they are used in the\nsame way, LiquidMetal has to be called differently so the test file was modified to work\nwith the LiquidMetal Syntax.\n\n# Ports\nPlease notify me of any ports so I can have them listed here.\nPlease also keep track of the string score version that you have ported from.
