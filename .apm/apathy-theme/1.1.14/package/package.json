Includes custom bundled fonts with multiple font-weights and **antialiased font smoothing** for clean rendering of text.\n\n### Features:\n* Includes 'Source Code Pro' and 'Inconsolata' web font which can be changed via settings panel\n* Thorough definitions for JS/Coffeescript/Meteor developers\n* Custom tree-view background (optional)\n* Optional alternate styles\n\n**Notes:**\n  - This will most likely override your current font in 'Settings'. If you don't like the font provided, you can override it in your custom stylesheet.  \n  - I **highly** recommend combining this with **[One Dark](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-ui)** - I personally think they match very well.\n  - This theme includes the following font weights in case you want to use them: 300, 500, 700, 900\n\n---\n\n# Screenshots\n\n### Javascript Colors:\n![JS Screenshot](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/2g403i3V0w2B2K0v2G2D/Image%202015-05-01%20at%207.36.00%20PM.png)\n\n### Coffeescript:\n![Coffeescript Screenshot](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/2e2v1z1Q2S0r443z0u2j/Image%202015-05-01%20at%207.47.31%20PM.png)\n\n### MeteorJS (w/ tree view styling enabled)\n![Meteor Screenshot](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/3b3s200N3C151Z101X12/Image%202015-05-01%20at%207.31.18%20PM.png)\n\n### Spacebarss:\n![Spacebars](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/3J070V2h070X182c3F1R/Image%202015-05-01%20at%207.42.33%20PM.png)\n\n### Jasmine:\n![Jasmine Screenshot](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/221H441D1p0q3o1b452n/Image%202015-05-01%20at%207.36.58%20PM.png)\n\n**Note:** To get Jasmine colors to work you need to:\n  1.  name your files `someFile.spec.js`\n  2.  make sure you have [file types](https://atom.io/packages/file-types) installed\n  3.  add the following in your config:\n\n      ```coffee\n      \"file-types\":\n        \"^[^.]+.js$\": \"source.js\"\n        \".spec.js$\": \"source.spec.js\"\n      ```\n  4. I've noticed that opening the settings panel for this package will mess up current settings that use regex, so try to only edit this setting via File > Open your config.\n\n### CSS/SASS/LESS:\n![CSS](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/2Q1H1W2R3o2F0C2b043K/Image%202015-05-01%20at%207.41.18%20PM.png)\n\n### HTML:\n![HTML Screenshot](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/0L3E1F1F1r3G2y242a0E/Image%202015-05-01%20at%207.39.59%20PM.png)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/coopermaruyama/apathy-theme/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/coopermaruyama/apathy-theme","_id":"apathy-theme@1.1.14","_shasum":"207b88a24827c4fdc9a87129db1f49e98ddfe3e9","_resolved":"file:../d-115425-10834-16xmhxm/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115425-10834-16xmhxm/package.tgz"}
